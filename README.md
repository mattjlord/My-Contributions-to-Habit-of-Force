# Summary

This is an abridged compilation of the code I worked on for the game Habit of Force during my time working for Sabre Fish Studios under professor Brandon Sichling at Northeastern University from July to December 2023. 

The primary goal of my work on the team was developing tools for members of the design team to create abilities for characters in the game. A secondary goal was to develop a framework for integrating combat visuals, such as animations and VFX, into a turn-based combat system. The code in this repository encompasses all of the work that was done to achieve these goals.

The folder "ActionsAbilities" contains code that I created entirely myself as part of the ability designer project, and the "CombatVisuals" folder contains all the work that was done for the combat visual integration project. The additional folders provided contain code for context/dependencies, where I contributed to part of the code, but not all of it.
